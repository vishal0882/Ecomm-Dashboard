# Trusted Certificate Setup

## ✅ Trusted Certificates Generated

Trusted SSL certificates have been generated using `mkcert` for localhost development.

### Certificate Files

- `localhost-key.pem` - Private key
- `localhost.pem` - Certificate (valid until March 8, 2028)

### Certificate Details

- **Valid for**: localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1
- **Expires**: March 8, 2028
- **Trusted**: Yes (generated by mkcert)

### Installing the Local CA (Optional but Recommended)

To make browsers automatically trust these certificates without warnings, install the local CA:

```bash
mkcert -install
```

**Note**: This requires your Mac password. It installs mkcert's root certificate into your system's trust store.

### Manual Browser Trust (Alternative)

If you prefer not to install the CA system-wide, you can:

1. **Chrome/Edge**: The certificate should work automatically with mkcert certificates
2. **Firefox**: May need to import the certificate manually
3. **Safari**: Should work automatically after CA installation

### Current Status

✅ Certificates generated and configured
✅ Server will use trusted certificates
✅ No more ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID errors

### Restart the Server

After certificates are in place, restart the server:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
npm run dev
```

The browser should now trust the connection without security warnings!
